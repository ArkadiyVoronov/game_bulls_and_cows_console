# Rules of the game "Bulls and cows":
Play two people. The first player conceives a four-digit number so that all the digits of the number are different. The second player must guess this number.
Moves are made in turn. Each turn is called a number, also four-digit and with different numbers. If the figure from the named number is in the guessed number, then this situation is called "cow". If the figure from the named number is in the guessed number and stands in the same place, then this situation is called "bull".
For example, the first player conceived 8569, and the second player called 8974. Then the first player must say: "One bull and one cow" (1B,1K).
Each partner has its own number. The winner is the one who guesses the number of the opponent before.
